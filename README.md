## Changes and Adjustments

### Icon Replacement
<p>Some icons were replaced to align them with the Font Awesome icons</p>

### Table Position
<p>
I moved the table to the front since it contains information related to the project and doesn't affect the video button or the image.

### Profile Pictures
<p>
I separated the images to distinguish each profile.

### Official App Store Icons
<p>
I replaced the logos with the official icons to avoid potential copyright issues.

## Notes:
- The website is responsive.
- The menu is of the sticky type to keep it always visible.
- I loaded the Halter font for the card digits and Montserrat in general for the web page.
- I loaded the Font Awesome icon library.
- JavaScript was used to make the hamburger menu work in the mobile version.
